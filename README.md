Memory and Puzzle Game----
This is a web-based game that tests users' memory and problem-solving skills. The game consists of two rounds: a memory card game and a 4x4 puzzle. Users must complete the memory card game with a maximum of 8 mismatches to qualify for the puzzle round, where they must arrange the tiles in ascending order as quickly as possible.

Game Rules-----
To participate in the game, users must complete the memory card game with a maximum of 8 mismatches to qualify for the puzzle round.
In the puzzle round, users must arrange the tiles in ascending order as quickly as possible.
If two or more users have the same completion time in the puzzle round, the user with the least number of mismatches in the memory card game wins.
Users can compete against each other for the highest score on the leaderboard.
The leaderboard ranks users based on their scores in both rounds



Scoring System----
Users are given points based on their performance in each round:

Memory Card Game (Level 1): Points are given based on the number of attempts taken to match the clues.
4x4 Puzzle (Level 2): Points are given based on the total number of seconds taken to complete the puzzle.


Leaderboard----
The leaderboard displays the top scores of all users who have completed at least one round of the game. Users are ranked based on their total score, with lower scores indicating higher rankings. If two or more users have the same score, the user who attempted both rounds is prioritized over the user who attempted only one round.

Usage---
Users can play the game by visiting the website and following the instructions on the main page. The game requires a web browser and an internet connection to play. Users can also view the leaderboard and compare their scores with other users.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
